            Bright regent of the heavens,<br>
          Say, why is everything<br>
            Either at sixes or at sevens?<br>
          I have lived hitherto<br>
            Free from breath of slander,<br>
          Beloved by all my crew—<br>
            A really popular commander.<br>
          But now my kindly crew rebel,<br>
            My daughter to a tar is partial,<br>
          Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,<br>
            He threatens a court martial!<br>

              <p> How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the unconscious<br>
               moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It  be! Who is<br>
               poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to falon one so<br>
               lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!</p>
               <h4 style="color: brown;">CAPT</h4> 
               <p>
  (coming down). Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?That is<br>
  not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable to have<br>
  gone on shore at dusk.
               </p>
               <h4 style="color: brown;">BUT</h4>
               <p>
                True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad pale<br>
  face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile before I go.<br>

               <p>
                Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I<br>
  recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon me, and<br>
  all my old friends seem to have turned against me!
               </p>
               <h4 style="color: brown;">BUT</h4>
               <p>
                Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were<br>
                unjust to one, at least.<br>
               </p>
               <h4 style="color: brown;">CAPT</h4> 
               <p>
                True, for you are staunch to me. (Aside.) If ever I
  gave my
  heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this! (Aloud.) I am<br>
  touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we<br>
  differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it is, I<br>
  fear I can never be more to you than a friend.

    Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
  feel that<br>
  they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new<br>

  she referring? Time alone can tell!

  <p>
    Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your<br>
  daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.<br>
    CAPT. She won't do, Sir Joseph!<br>
    SIR JOSEPH. I'm afraid not. The fact is, that although I have<br>
  urged my<br>
  suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official<br>
  utterance,<br>
  I have done so hitherto without success. How do you account for
  this?
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: brown;">CAPT</h4>
  <p>
    Really, Sir Joseph, I hardly know. Josephine is of course<br>
  sensible of your condescension.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: royalblue;"> SIR JOSEPH</h4>
  <p>
    She naturally would be
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: brown;">CAPT</h4>
  <p>
     But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her.<br>
     You think it does?<br>
     I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her<br>
  social<br>
  position is far below your own. It may be that she feels she is<br>
  not<br>
  worthy of you.
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: royalblue;"> SIR JOSEPH</h4>
  <p>
    That is really a very sensible suggestion, and<br>
  displays
  more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for<br>
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: brown;">CAPT</h4>
  <p>
    See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason with<br>
  her and<br>
  assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty<br>
  that<br>
  love levels all ranks, her respect for an official utterance<br>
  might induce<br>
  her to look upon your offer in its proper light.
  </p>
  <h4 style="color: royalblue;"> SIR JOSEPH</h4>
  <p>
    It is not unlikely. I will adopt your suggestion.<br>
  But soft,<br>
  she is here. Let us withdraw, and watch our opportunity.
